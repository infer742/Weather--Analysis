# Weather Analysis of some Major German Cities

As someone who is constantly cold and just *hates* bad weather, I started looking for climate diagrams that depict exactly that. But it turned out: The kind of data I was interested in was surprisingly hard to come by and usually not up-to-date or configurable. So, I decided to make my only little analysis which, well, is still a work-in-progress. But I hope it will be useful to some of my fellow 'chilly-mortals'. Those of you who always carry a thick sweater or woolen cap, even in summer, know what I mean :)

The key diagrams can be found here

**Data source**: The data I used is part of the 'opendata' section of the German Metereological Service (DWD) and can be found here: https://opendata.dwd.de/climate_environment/CDC/observations_germany/climate/daily/kl/historical/

I pulled the data on the first of February 2022.
